# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

## Overview

The **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system is designed to demonstrate secure implementation of **Authentication**, **Authorization**, and access management using roles. It provides functionality to **register**, **log in**, **log out**, and restrict access to resources based on user roles such as **Admin**, **User**, and **Moderator**. The system ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions, maintaining the principles of least privilege.

The project uses modern authentication techniques, including **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for token-based authentication and role-based middleware to enforce access control.

## My Role in Implementing the RBAC System

### System Design:
- Designed the database schema to support user roles and permissions efficiently.
- Planned the folder structure for scalability and maintainability.

### Authentication:
- Implemented secure user registration and login using **bcrypt** for password hashing.
- Used **JWT** to issue tokens for authenticated users.

### Authorization:
- Developed middleware to verify JWT tokens and decode user roles.
- Integrated **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to restrict access based on roles.

### API Development:
- Created RESTful API endpoints for registration, login, logout, and protected routes.
- Added role-specific endpoints like the Admin Dashboard.

### Security Best Practices:
- Implemented security measures such as input validation and token expiration.
- Used environment variables for sensitive information like JWT secrets.

### Testing:
- Conducted manual testing using **Postman** to verify the correctness of all endpoints.
- Tested edge cases for invalid tokens, expired tokens, and unauthorized access.

- ## Testing the System
  - Use Postman or similar tools to test the following endpoints:
  - Register: POST /api/auth/register
  - Login: POST /api/auth/login
  - Get Profile: GET /api/users/profile (requires JWT token)
  - Admin Route: GET /api/users/admin (requires Admin role)
  - Test edge cases:
  - Attempt login with incorrect credentials.
  - Access protected routes without a token or with an expired/invalid token.
  - Try accessing Admin routes as a non-admin user.

## Key Features

### User Registration and Login:
- Users can register with a unique email and password.
- Logged-in users receive a JWT token for subsequent requests.

### Role Management:
- Users are assigned roles such as **Admin**, **User**, or **Moderator**.
- Each role has specific permissions to access different routes.

### RBAC Middleware:
- Middleware restricts route access based on user roles.
- Unauthorized users attempting to access restricted routes are denied with appropriate error messages.

### Session Management:
- Tokens have a configurable expiration time.
- Users can log out, invalidating their session.

### Scalability and Extensibility:
- Designed to easily add new roles and permissions.
